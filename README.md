# Spotify Recommendation System

I implemented a music recommendation system. It groups songs into clusters using K-Means and then compares a selected song to all others based on numeric features to measure similarity. The system calculates a distance score for each song and sorts them to find the closest matches. Finally, it returns a list of the 10 most similar songs with their names and artists.
